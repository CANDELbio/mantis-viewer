## Overview

Mantis Viewer allows users to load and analyze sets of images, or 'image sets' that contain multiple TIFF files. Each TIFF should contain one or multiple greyscale images of markers from a tissue slide. The below animation gives a brief overview of opening an image set and interacting with the channel and image controls. See below for detailed instructions.
