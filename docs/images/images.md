## Overview

Mantis Viewer allows users to load and analyze images composed of multiple grayscale layers or markers. Mantis supports loading these grayscale layers from TIFF files, each of which should contain one or multiple greyscale layers from a tissue slide. The below animation gives a brief overview of opening an image and interacting with the channel and image controls. See below for detailed instructions.
