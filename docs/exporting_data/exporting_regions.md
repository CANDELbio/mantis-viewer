## Exporting Regions to a TIFF

Mantis supports exporting the regions selected on the image for use in other applications. You can export the regions selected on the current image to a TIFF that uses the same format for [importing segmentation and region data]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link docs/importing_data/importing_segmentation_region.md %}) by navigating to the main menu and then selecting `Export` followed by `Regions to TIFF`.
