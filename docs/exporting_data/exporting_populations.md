## Exporting Populations to CSV

Mantis supports exporting populations to CSVs for use in other applications. You can export the populations stored in Mantis by navigating to the main menu and then selecting `Export` followed by `Populations` and finally `For active image from CSV` or `For project from single CSV`. Note that these menu item will be disabled unless segmentation data has been loaded for the currently active image.
