If you wish to change the marker selected for a channel you can click on the dropdown and select a new channel. If you wish to clear a channel you can click the x on the channel select dropdown. You can adjust the brightness of a channel by changing the min and max values on the slider below the channel dropdown. The min and max values are set using the pixel intensities from the channel’s TIFF. Brightness adjustments are achieved by means of a linear transform. You can quickly toggle the visibility of a channel by clicking on the eye icon next to the brightness slider. Image Controls . Other image controls that do not affect the channels can be accessed by clicking on the button Show Image Controls. From the Image Controls you can toggle the presence of a zoom inset indicator and a legend on the image that indicates which markers are currently visible and the channels they are selected for. Once segmentation data has been loaded, the Image Controls can also be used to adjust segmentation visualization settings. Switching Between Image Sets .

If you just want to look at images from a single slide or ROI you can choose to import an image set. If you want to analyze and compare multiple image sets you can chose to open a new project. For an image set Mantis expects one folder with a single multi-image TIFF or multiple single-image TIFFs (one per marker). If you have multiple images from many slides or ROIs, you can import a project. For a project, Mantis expects expects a folder containing multiple image sets. See the below screenshot for an example file structure of a project with detailed view of one of the contained image sets. When you open a new project Mantis will open a popup (shown below) that will walk you through setting up the project. If you’ve already gone through the import process you can bypass it by choosing to open the project as an existing project. When importing a new project, Mantis will first ask you to select the root directory of the project you would like to import. Once you’ve selected the root directory, Mantis will automatically select a representative image set for the rest of the process, but you can change the representative image set if you need to. The image subdirectory dropdown will be populated with any directories that are present within the representative image set. It allows you to choose a directory within your representative image set that stores all of the image files. If unselected, Mantis will load all images from the root of each image set. If you do select an image subdirectory all of the image sets in the project must have the same image subdirectory folder name. The region file and segmentation file dropdowns will be enabled and populated with files from the representative image set. You can read more about the formats that Mantis accepts for region and segmentation files on the importing segmentation and region data page. The segment features file and populations file dropdowns will be enabled and populated with CSV files from the root project directory.

    "title": "Supported Image Formats",
    "content": "Mantis currently supports loading images from two types of TIFFs: a folder containing multiple greyscale single-image TIFFs or a folder containing one greyscale multi-image TIFF. In the case of multi-image TIFFs, each image within the TIFF must be stored within its own image file directory (IFD). Mantis does not support other types of multi-image TIFF files (such as hyperstacks), but there are plans to add support in the future. In the interim you can use image-utils to split up unsupported multi-image TIFFs into single channel TIFFs that can be analyzed by Mantis. Inferring Marker Names . Mantis will attempt to parse the ImageDescription tag for each image file directory as an XML string. If parsing is successful Mantis will search for an element called name within the parsed XML tree. If Mantis finds an element called name it will take the text value of the name element and use that value as the marker name. If Mantis is unable to parse the ImageDescription tag as an XML string or does not find an element called name, it will use the filename as the marker name. In the case of multi-image TIFFs, Mantis will append the image file directory index to the filename and use that as the marker name if it is unable to find a name in the ImageDescription tag. Downsampling Images . Mantis will downsample images when either the width or the height of the image is greater than 10,000 pixels. There are plans to build support for viewing higher resolution images without downsampling in later releases. Additional Formats . If you encounter an image that you expect to work with Mantis but doesn’t or if you need help getting your images into a format that Mantis supports feel free to create an issue on the GitHub page or send us an email at engineering@parkerici.org.
